--  2.3.1.6 Interpolator
--
--  Stare at Figure 8 on page 33 of the datasheet until it makes sense.
--
--  There are two interpolators per core, mapped via the SIO peripheral. This
--  driver treats them as separate peripherals, but they really aren't.
--
--  Due to the relatively simple structure of the INTERP registers and the
--  desire for single cycle operation, this driver exposes the register records
--  directly rather than wrapping them with procedures.

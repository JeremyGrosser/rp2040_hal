# Raspberry Pi RP2040 HAL (Ada)

This repository contains drivers for the [RP2040 SoC](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf). This library is meant to be used with [pico_bsp](https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/pico_bsp), which supplies a linker script and boot code, along with a board definition. Example code is available in [pico_examples](https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/pico_examples)

This is not production ready code and all of the APIs here are still subject to change.

Development discussion is happening on Gitter: [https://gitter.im/ada-lang/raspberrypi-pico](https://gitter.im/ada-lang/raspberrypi-pico)
